            <h2>üíö Three Green Flags That Signal "Keeper"</h2>
            <p>I'm guessing you're going to fall in love with a woman who is beautiful on the outside. But these green flags will help you identify a woman who is beautiful on the inside‚Äîthe kind that makes for a lasting, fulfilling relationship.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="keeper-banner">
            <h3>üèÜ The Ultimate Goal</h3>
            <p>You want a woman who enhances your life, respects your value, and chooses you even when she has other options. These green flags help you identify exactly that woman.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="green-flag-section">
            <div class="flag-number">‚úÖ</div>
            <h3 class="flag-title">She Respects Your Time</h3>
            
            <div class="flag-description">
                Even if she's going to be 15 minutes late to a date, if she goes out of her way to tell you and give you an explanation as to why, that's a keeper. This shows she values your time and respects you as a person.
            </div>

            <div class="why-special">
                <h4>üíé Why This Is Special</h4>
                <p>In our culture of flakiness and casual disrespect, a woman who proactively communicates about delays shows maturity, consideration, and genuine respect for your investment in the relationship.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="what-it-shows">
                <h4>üéØ What This Shows About Her</h4>
                <p>She understands that your time has value, she takes responsibility for her actions, and she cares about how her behavior affects you. These are foundational qualities for a healthy relationship.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="examples">
                <h4>üì± What This Looks Like</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Texting 20 minutes before the date if traffic is bad</li>
                    <li>Calling if something unexpected comes up that might make her late</li>
                    <li>Apologizing genuinely when she is late, even for good reasons</li>
                    <li>Arriving early or on time consistently</li>
                    <li>Giving you advance notice if she needs to reschedule</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="relationship-impact">
                <h4>üöÄ Long-term Impact</h4>
                <p>A woman who respects your time will respect your feelings, your boundaries, and your needs throughout the relationship. This is a predictor of how she'll treat you when the honeymoon phase ends.</p>

            <div class="flag-description">
                I know independent women are celebrated in our culture, and so if a woman goes out of her way to ask for your opinion, especially on something that impacts you like weekend plans or travel that she's thinking of doing, that woman is a huge green flag.
            </div>

            <div class="why-special">
                <h4>üíé Why This Matters</h4>
                <p>In an era where independence is often confused with isolation, a woman who actively seeks your input shows she values your perspective and wants to build something together, not just exist side-by-side.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="what-it-shows">
                <h4>üéØ What This Reveals</h4>
                <p>She sees you as a partner, not just a boyfriend. She understands that relationships involve two people making decisions together, and she respects your intelligence and judgment enough to seek your counsel.</p>
            </div>
